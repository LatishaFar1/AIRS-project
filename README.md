# About A.I.R.S.

The Avengers Incident Reporting System provides people with a platform to submit negative incidents (big or small) they encounter with the Avengers and those affiliated with them.

The app includes a form to submit a complaint, a page to view all complaints logged, a page of lawyers (if they're necessary), and an emergency alert on the home page.
